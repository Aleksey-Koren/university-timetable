# university-timetable
Timetable management web-application for university, based on MVC pattern (Student project) This is a web application which will be used by the manager to compile the university schedule. In this project I used PostgreSQL as database. This is SpringBoot application. Database access is organized using JPA with Hibernate as implementation. Views were written using Thymeleaf with HTML. Code was covered by unit tests using JUnit 5, Mockito and MockMVC (for testing controllers).
