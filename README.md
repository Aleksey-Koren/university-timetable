# university-timetable
Timetable management web-application for university based on MVC pattern (Student project)
This is a web application for university which will be used by the manager to compile the university schedule.
In this project i used PostgreSQL as database. Application is built using the MVC architecture. Views were written using Thymeleaf with HTML.
Code was covered by unit tests using JUnit 5, Mockito and MockMVC (for testing controllers).
The project is not finished. I am still working on it.
